## SLIDE 2: Problem

### Crypto traders are flying blind

1. **Information Overload** — Thousands of data points, but no actionable insights. Traders drown in noise while missing real opportunities.

2. **Fragmented Tools** — Traders juggle 5-10 different platforms: charting on TradingView, data on Glassnode, execution on Binance, DEX on Uniswap, alerts on Discord...

3. **Institutional Disadvantage** — Professional traders have Bloomberg terminals. Retail crypto traders? Nothing comparable exists.

4. **Experience Gap** — It takes years to develop the pattern recognition and market intuition that separates profitable traders from the rest.

> *"But how do you trade confidently without years of experience?"*
