## SLIDE 1: Company Purpose

# PANDA Terminal

**One sentence:** We give every crypto trader the institutional intelligence and execution power that was previously only available to hedge funds.

---

## SLIDE 2: Problem

### Crypto traders lose billions to information asymmetry

**The Pain:**
- **Fragmented Tools** — Traders juggle 5-10 platforms daily: TradingView for charts, Glassnode for on-chain, exchanges for execution, Discord for signals. Each switch = missed opportunities.
- **No Actionable Intelligence** — 1000+ data sources, but 85% is noise. Traders drown in metrics that don't predict anything.
- **Institutional Lock-out** — Bloomberg terminals cost $24K/year. The best trading signals? Locked behind fund-level subscriptions.
- **Experience Moat** — It takes 3-5 years to develop the pattern recognition that separates profitable traders from the rest.

**The Cost:** An estimated $2.4B annually lost to retail traders making decisions without institutional-grade intelligence.

---

## SLIDE 3: Solution

### The Bloomberg Terminal for Crypto

PANDA unifies research, proprietary analytics, and execution into one platform — making institutional-grade trading accessible to everyone.

**The Transformation:**
| Before PANDA | After PANDA |
|--------------|-------------|
| 5-10 fragmented tools | One unified terminal |
| Raw data overload | Actionable intelligence (50+ proprietary metrics) |
| Delayed execution across platforms | CEX + DEX trading in one click |
| Years to develop edge | AI-powered signals from day one |

**Core Value:** Trade faster and more confidently — at any experience level.

**Pricing:** Starting at $29/month vs $24,000/year for Bloomberg.

----------------------------

SLIDE 4: Why Now
Current Strengths: Four solid market trends identified
Improvements Needed:
Add a "Timing Proof Point" — Show you're not too early or late
**The Moment:**- 2020: Too early — retail didn't have capital or sophistication- 2021: Too chaotic — everyone was gambling, not analyzing  - 2024: Perfect — battle-tested traders demand real tools, infrastructure is ready- 2026+: Too late — incumbents will have caught up**We're in the 18-month window.**
Quantify the AI inflection — Don't just say it's possible
Current: "Proprietary signals now computationally viable"Better: "What cost $50K/month in compute in 2021 now costs $500. We can give retail traders hedge fund signals at SaaS prices."
Add regulatory tailwind
- SEC crypto ETF approvals signal mainstream legitimacy- MiCA in Europe creating compliance-first opportunities- Clearer rules = institutional money flowing in = retail needs better tools to compete
SLIDE 5: Market Potential
Current Strengths: Clear TAM/SAM/SOM structure with growth rates
Improvements Needed:
Show your capture strategy — Don't just size the market
**Our Path to $50M ARR:**- 500M crypto holders → 10% are active traders (50M)- 10% seek pro tools (5M addressable)- 1% conversion = 50,000 paying users- $83 ARPU (blended) = $50M ARR**We need 0.01% of crypto holders to hit our 2027 target.**
Add comparable exits — Show the market rewards winners
**Comparables:**- TradingView: $3B valuation (60M users)- Glassnode: Raised $10M Series A- Bloomberg Terminal: $11B revenue from 325K subscribers
Add the "Why not Bloomberg?" answer
**Why Bloomberg won't win crypto:**- $24K/year pricing excludes 99.9% of market- No DEX/DeFi integration- Crypto-native UX expectations they can't meet
SLIDE 6: Competition
Current Strengths: Clear feature matrix, defined moat
Improvements Needed:
Pick 2 dimensions that matter most — Matrix is good but add a 2x2 positioning map
**Positioning:**                    Full Analytics                         ↑            Glassnode    |    PANDA ★                         |    Charting ←———————————+———————————→ Execution                         |            TradingView  |    Exchange Native                         ↓                    Basic Tools
Address the "why won't TradingView just add this?"
**Defensibility:**- TradingView's business model is charting subscriptions — adding trading creates channel conflict with broker partners- Our proprietary metrics (Divine Dip, CARI, ROSI) took 3+ years of quant development- Data aggregation moat: We process orderflow from 15+ sources — takes 18+ months to replicate
Name specific wins — Have you taken users from competitors?
**Switch Stories:**- "Cancelled TradingView + Glassnode ($80/mo) for PANDA Pro ($29/mo)" — 340 users in Q4
SLIDE 7: Product

**How traders use PANDA:**Morning: Check Token Ratings for opportunities (2 min)Signal: Divine Dip fires on SOL (alert to phone)Action: One-click buy from mobile (30 sec)Result: Caught the bottom, exit at +6%
Show the UI — Screenshots matter more than descriptions
[Consider adding 3 small screenshots:]1. Workbench with Divine Dip indicator2. Token Rating dashboard  3. One-click trade modal
SLIDE 8: Business Model
Current Strengths: Clear pricing tiers, multiple revenue streams
Improvements Needed:
Show the funnel — How do free users become paid?
**Conversion Funnel:**Free signup → Use basic charts (Week 1)→ Hit metric paywall (Week 2-3)→ Start free trial of Pro (Week 3)→ Convert to paid (Week 4) — 8% conversion rate**Key insight:** Users who see Divine Dip fire once convert at 23%
Clarify trading fee economics
**Trading Revenue Model:**- Partner exchanges pay 20-40% of trading fees as referral- Average trader: $5K volume/month → $15 in fees → $4.50 to PANDA- Heavy traders (Elite tier): $50K volume/month → $45/mo incremental
Add expansion revenue
**Land and Expand:**- Pro users who upgrade to Elite: 12% after 6 months- API access upsell: $199/mo (15% of Elite users)- Net Revenue Retention: 115%
SLIDE 9: Team
